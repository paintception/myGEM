<!--l. 31--><p class="noindent" >The Agents have been modelled according to the <span 
class="ecti-1000">BDI Architecture</span>, an epistemic logic
based system proposed in *ref* in 1991. The paper states how important Beliefs,
Desires and Intentions are in determining the behaviour of rational agents, more in
detail the authors assert how every rational action which is taken from an agent is
based on these three components. The combination of these features have an impact
on the agent&#8217;s future since they produce different actions and as a consequence give
rise to different future scenarios. These possible scenarios, called <span 
class="ecti-1000">Worlds</span>, are
modelled according to a temporal structure and are defined as <span 
class="ecti-1000">Time Trees</span>, every
moment in the time tree is the result of an action based on the three previously
mentioned BDI features and is defined as <span 
class="ecti-1000">Situation</span>. One Agent can move
between different time situations until it achieves its goal. The three BDI
components have a different impact on the agent&#8217;s behaviour and are defined as
follows:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Beliefs: are defined as those worlds that the agent believes to be possible,
     technically every <span 
class="ecti-1000">Belief </span>is considered as a complete and independent <span 
class="ecti-1000">Time</span>
     <span 
class="ecti-1000">Tree </span>since there are no restrictions that can avoid an Agent to believe
     something. This feature is formalized as follows: <span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2200; </span>w <span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2208; </span>W. <br 
class="newline" />Where w corresponds to a single time tree and W as the entire set of
     beliefs.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Desires: are those worlds that correspond to the optimal future scenario
     an agent wants to achieve, an agent can be happy with multiple outcomes
     but usually the main <span 
class="ecti-1000">Desire </span>is a single one and can be expressed by the
     following formalism: <span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2203;</span><span 
class="cmr-10">! </span>w <span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2208; </span>W.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Intentions:  are  considered  as  sets  of  intention-accessible  worlds.  These
     worlds  are  ones  that  the  agent  has  committed  to  attempt  to  realize.
     Differently from the <span 
class="ecti-1000">Beliefs</span>, where all possible worlds are considered, the
     <span 
class="ecti-1000">Intention </span>feature is characterized by a strong component of realism since
     the worlds that are part of this feature are only the ones that the Agent
     thinks can be a possible <span 
class="ecti-1000">Desire</span>. Intentions are formalized as follows:
     </li></ul>
<!--l. 42--><p class="indent" >   In addition to the three BDI features some extra parameters have been added in
order to model the agents. The reason this has been done is related to the genetic
algorithm that has been used in order to simulate their behaviour and is explained
into more detail in the next section. The parameters that have been added to the
architecture are different according to the type of agent that has been modelled,
however the general idea is the same one for both of them. In order to represent a
potential level of <span 
class="ecti-1000">Beliefs, Desires </span>and <span 
class="ecti-1000">Intentions </span>in a <span 
class="ecti-1000">spyGEM </span>scenario some extra
features related to this specific world have been added that might have an impact
on all three BDI components and as a consequence on the agents&#8217; actions.
<br 
class="newline" />Regarding a potential <span 
class="ecti-1000">Sender </span>the three additional features that have been added are
the following:
                                                                  

                                                                  
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B3;</span>: which corresponds to a particular level of <span 
class="ecti-1000">riskiness </span>the agent will take
     into account in his actions. The impact of this feature is different on the
     three BDI components, in fact a high level of riskiness makes the agent
     have a smaller set of total <span 
class="ecti-1000">Beliefs </span>since there is no reason to think about
     all those worlds that involve highly safe scenarios. On the other side it is
     possible that a high level of <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B3; </span>leads to the optimal desired world and as a
     consequence to a world the agent thinks requires commitment.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03C8;</span>: is a variable that is related to the level of <span 
class="ecti-1000">efficiency </span>that the agent
     wants to pursue in its actions. In this case the higher this value is the
     higher the value of the three BDI components will be.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B1;</span>: corresponds to the <span 
class="ecti-1000">time resources </span>the agent is willing to invest when
     creating its BDI features, the impact of this variable is similar to the
     previous one. The more time that is invested by an agent, the higher the
     set of Beliefs will be and the overall commitment to the possible worlds
     towards the optimal scenario.</li></ul>
<!--l. 50--><p class="indent" >   The idea of the model was to identify which of the three BDI components is
considered as more important by a potential <span 
class="ecti-1000">Sender </span>agent who wants to hide and
send an encrypted message as safely as possible and by a <span 
class="ecti-1000">Criminal </span>who wants to
avoid this scenario. In order to find this out a genetic algorithm has been used on
different randomly generated agents and the level of the three BDI features has been
measured. <br 
class="newline" />Genetic algorithms are a very common machine learning technique that is used in
different Artificial Intelligence optimization problems, they are largely inspired by
natural evolution and work as follows: a random set of possible solutions is
created, each of these solutions goes through a fitness function which measures
how close these solutions perform to the optimal result that wants to be
achieved. It is important to notice that the individual values that make it
possible to converge to the optimal result are not known beforehand, the only
information that is known is the final outcome which can be achieved in multiple
ways.<br 
class="newline" />Once the agents are evaluated by the fitness function a truncation process
occurs, similarly as what happens in nature where only the fittest animals
survive, also in the simulation the only agents that are allowed to be part
and give rise to a new generation are the ones with higher fitness scores.
How new generations are created more into detail is presented in the next
subsection.

<!--l. 57--><p class="noindent" >An Agent is created as a string of binary bits and is represented as a chromosome,
each part of it represents the three BDI features together with the three additional
parameters mentioned in the previous section. An example of a randomly generated
agent is the following:

sender Agent an optimal value of 60 has been set, this turned out in the following
fitness function, where n is the total length of the chromosome and the main aim is
to find the optimal set of bits that satisfy it:

<!--l. 73--><p class="indent" >   For our <span

the most suitable ones while considering optimal convergence and training
time:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">20 Simulations: a total number of twenty different simulations have been
     run in order to check if the results where coherent between each other.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">20 Pools of 100 Chromosomes: the simulation starts with 20 randomly
     generated chromosome pools with 100 agents each. This is the first set
     of agents that is evaluated by the fitness function and according to the
     fitness scores the breeding process starts.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Truncation Method: is the approach that has been used in order to keep the
     fittest agents allowed to reproduce themselves, in order to avoid overfitting
     issues the top 70% of the agents has been kept while the rest 30% has
     been discarded.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">One point single crossover: is the breeding method that has been used.
     Once two chromosomes are chosen as parents they give birth to two new
     children by exchanging 3 of their bits. This technique is shown hereafter:
