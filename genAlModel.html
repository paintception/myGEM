<!--l. 27--><p class="noindent" >Once the <span 
class="ecti-1000">spyGEM </span>project started, before moving our attention to a broader
perspective involving big data storage, we considered our idea as a possible way of
sending sensitive information in a very secure way. Thanks to the combination of the
Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm and the biological security layers that
make it hard to get to the point in which it is possible to sequence the DNA of a
bacteria, <span 
class="ecti-1000">spyGEM </span>originally would have been the newest method to use for sending
                                                                  

                                                                  
highly reserved information. Most of the research that has been done in the
lab in order to make our system as safe as possible, has been inspired by
imagining possible scenarios involving the potential users of <span 
class="ecti-1000">spyGEM</span>. "What
might happen if the agents wouldn&#8217;t have enough knowledge to successfully
make <span 
class="ecti-1000">spyGEM </span>work?" or "What could happen if one agent would be in
possession of enough sensitive information in order to make the whole procedure
fail?" are only two out of the multiple questions that made it clear that
in order to create an efficient product, there was need to understand and
imagine future scenarios involving the possible users of the system. The two
main agents that turned out to be the most significant ones were a potential
<span 
class="ecti-1000">Sender </span>agent, that has as main goal hiding and sending as safely as possible a
top-secret message, and a potential <span 
class="ecti-1000">Criminal</span>, who wants to avoid this scenario.
Imagining all the possible interactions between these two actors is of course
impossible to achieve, however it is possible to simulate part of their behaviours
assuming they are rational. In order to do so we have been inspired by work (1)
where an Artificial Intelligence architecture based on Epistemic Logic is
proposed for modelling rational agents. This gave us the opportunity to simulate
different type of Agents and through the use of a genetic algorithm explore
the different features that characterize their rationality. By exploring and
computing the optimal features we have been able to identify the core points that
have to be considered when building <span 
class="ecti-1000">spyGEM </span>in the most efficient way as
possible. The following sections explain how the computational model has
been built and trained in order to identify the most important aspects of
the A.I. architecture, and how this knowledge has guided the whole lab
work.

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-20002"></a>Architecture of the Model</h3>
<!--l. 31--><p class="noindent" >The Agents have been modelled according to the <span 
class="ecti-1000">BDI Architecture</span>, an epistemic
logic based system proposed in (1) in 1991. The paper states how important
Beliefs, Desires and Intentions are in determining the behaviour of rational
agents, more in detail the authors assert how every rational action taken from
an agent is basically based on these three components. The combination
of these features have an impact on the agent&#8217;s future, in fact they have
the ability to produce different actions and as a consequence give rise to
different future scenarios. These possible scenarios, called <span 
class="ecti-1000">Worlds</span>, are modelled
according to a temporal structure and are defined as <span 
class="ecti-1000">Time Trees</span>, every
moment in the time tree is the result of an action based on the three previously
mentioned BDI features and is defined as a <span 
class="ecti-1000">Situation</span>. One Agent can move
between different time situations until it achieves its goal. The three BDI
components have a different impact on the agent&#8217;s behaviour and are defined as
follows:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Beliefs: are defined as those worlds that the agent believes to be possible,
     technically every <span 
class="ecti-1000">Belief </span>is considered as a complete and independent <span 
class="ecti-1000">Time</span>
     <span 
class="ecti-1000">Tree </span>since there are no restrictions that can avoid an Agent to believe in
                                                                  

                                                                  
     something. This feature is formalized as follows: <span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2200; </span>w <span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2208; </span>W. <br 
class="newline" />Where w corresponds to a single time tree and W as the entire set of
     beliefs.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Desires: are those worlds that correspond to the optimal future scenario
     an agent wants to achieve, an agent can be happy with multiple outcomes
     but usually the main <span 
class="ecti-1000">Desire </span>is a single one and can be expressed by the
     following formalism: <span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2203;</span><span 
class="cmr-10">! </span>w <span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2208; </span>W.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Intentions:  are  considered  as  sets  of  intention-accessible  worlds.  These
     worlds  are  ones  that  the  agent  has  committed  to  attempt  to  realize.
     Differently from the <span 
class="ecti-1000">Beliefs</span>, where all possible worlds are considered, the
     <span 
class="ecti-1000">Intention </span>feature is characterized by a strong component of realism since
     the worlds that are part of this feature are only the ones that the Agent
     thinks can be a possible <span 
class="ecti-1000">Desire</span>.
     </li></ul>
<!--l. 42--><p class="indent" >   In addition to the three BDI features some extra parameters have been added in
order to model the agents. The reason this has been done is related to the genetic
algorithm that has been used in order to simulate their behaviour and is explained
into more detail in the next section. The parameters that have been added to the
architecture are different according to the type of agent that has been modelled,
however the general idea is the same one for both of them. In order to represent a
potential level of <span 
class="ecti-1000">Beliefs, Desires </span>and <span 
class="ecti-1000">Intentions </span>in a <span 
class="ecti-1000">spyGEM </span>scenario some extra
features related to this architecture have been added that might have an impact on
all three BDI components and as a consequence on the Agents&#8217; actions.
<br 
class="newline" />Regarding a potential <span 
class="ecti-1000">Sender </span>the three additional features that have been added are
the following:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B3;</span>: which corresponds to a particular level of <span 
class="ecti-1000">riskiness </span>the agent will take
     into account in his actions. The impact of this feature is different on the
     three BDI components, in fact a high level of riskiness makes the agent
     have a smaller set of total <span 
class="ecti-1000">Beliefs </span>since there is no reason to think about
     all those worlds that involve highly safe scenarios. On the other side it is
     possible that a high level of <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B3; </span>leads to the optimal desired world and as a
     consequence to a world the agent thinks requires commitment.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03C8;</span>: is a variable that is related to the level of <span 
class="ecti-1000">efficiency </span>that the agent
     wants to pursue in its actions. In this case the higher this value is, the
     higher the value of the three BDI components will be.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B1;</span>: corresponds to the <span 
class="ecti-1000">time resources </span>the agent is willing to invest when
     creating its BDI features, the impact of this variable is similar to the
     previous one. The more time that is invested by an agent, the higher the
     set of Beliefs will be and the overall commitment to the possible worlds
     towards the optimal scenario.</li></ul>
                                                                  

                                                                  
<!--l. 50--><p class="indent" >   Regarding the <span 
class="ecti-1000">Criminal </span>Agent the meaning of <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03C8; </span>and <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B1; </span>has been changed. The
first value corresponds to the amount of knowledge the agent has about
the different <span 
class="ecti-1000">Time Trees </span>while the second one is related to the amount of
motivation and effort he is willing to put while interfering with the <span 
class="ecti-1000">Sender&#8217;s </span>plan.
<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 52--><p class="indent" >   The idea of the model was to identify which of the three BDI components is
considered as more important by a potential <span 
class="ecti-1000">Sender </span>agent who wants to hide and
send an encrypted message as safely as possible and by a <span 
class="ecti-1000">Criminal </span>who wants to
avoid this scenario. In order to find this out a genetic algorithm has been
used on different randomly generated agents and the level of the three BDI
features has been measured once the algorithm converged to the optimal result.
<br 
class="newline" />Genetic algorithms are a very common machine learning technique that is used in
different Artificial Intelligence optimization problems (2, 3, 4), they are largely
inspired by natural evolution and work as follows: a random set of possible solutions
is created, each of these solutions goes through a fitness function which measures
how close these solutions perform to the optimal result that wants to be
achieved. It is important to notice that the individual values that make it
possible to converge to the optimal result are not known beforehand, the only
information that is known is the final outcome, which can be achieved in multiple
ways.<br 
class="newline" />Once the agents are evaluated by the fitness function a truncation process
occurs, similarly as what happens in nature where only the fittest animals
survive, also in the simulation the only agents that are allowed to be part and
give rise to a new generation are the ones with the higher fitness scores.
How new generations are created more into detail is presented in the next
subsection.

each part of it represents the three BDI features together with the three additional
parameters mentioned in the previous section. An example of a randomly generated
agent is the following:

summed together establishes the total fitness value of the chromosome. For the
sender Agent an optimal value of 60 has been set, this turned out in the following
fitness function, where n is the total length of the chromosome and the main aim is
to find the optimal set of bits that satisfy it:

<!--l. 117--><p class="noindent" >As already introduced previously some of the additional BDI features have been
changed while modelling the <span

how the Agent is represented which still corresponds to a string of binary bits. In
order to make the computational simulation more varied some changes have
been made to the genetic algorithm starting from the fitness function which
in this case has as optimal result a value of 65 as shown by the following
equation:

<!--l. 123--><p class="indent" >   Also in this case while training the Agents 20 different simulations have been ran
that started with 20 pools of 100 chromosomes each, however the truncation method
kept the top 80% of the Agents and not 70% as in the previous case and the
breeding technique that has been used was the <span 
class="cmmi-10">n </span>double crossover method.
It consists in exchanging not only one single set of bits but two of them
of 3 bits each as explained hereafter, the mutation rate has been kept to
1%.

<!--l. 154--><p class="noindent" >The aim of this section is twofold, on the one side it proves how it is possible to
model artificial agents through the use of a genetic algorithm while on the other
side it explains the relevance of this multi-agent simulation in the <span 
class="ecti-1000">spyGEM</span>
project and how the relative results have been inspiring for the lab work.
<br 
class="newline" />Considering the first goal, as explained by Figures 1 and 3 it is indeed possible to
modify the structure of the Agents in order to satisfy their relative fitness
functions through the use of a bio-computing technique. The structure of the
string of bits representing the <span 
class="ecti-1000">Sender </span>and the <span 
class="ecti-1000">Criminal </span>makes it possible
to modify the Agents in a relatively short training time by converging to
the optimal result already in 20 generations. These results show how this
particular machine learning technique can be used for modelling Multi-Agent
Systems and are in line with work (3). However the most remarkable and
useful results have been provided by the final analysis of the different BDI
features representing the agents. The histograms show in fact a significant
difference that has lead the development of the whole <span 
class="ecti-1000">spyGEM </span>project.
<br 
class="newline" />Considering Figure 1, the results show how in the case of the <span 
class="ecti-1000">Sender </span>model, the
Belief feature is the one that the generations of artificial agents discard in order to
get to the optimal score. In fact for 15 times as shown by the yellow histogram it is
the BDI component with the lowest value, 6. This is remarkable since it shows how
not too many resources should be invested in imagining all possible scenarios when
sending a secret message, but it is better to have a strong set of Desires that
nicely match with the Intention feature and pursue a single one of those.
This can nicely be seen in the graph where an optimal value of 13 has been
chosen by the agents for the Desire and Intention features for more then 20
times. The same is not true for the <span 
class="ecti-1000">Criminal </span>model where in order to be
successful the generations of agents have to consider as equally important all
the three BDI components. This is supported by the histograms that show
how Beliefs, Desires and Intentions occur almost equally with a value of 15.
<br 
class="newline" />Considering this simulation and the main goal of <span 
class="ecti-1000">spyGEM </span>that sees a potential
<span 
class="ecti-1000">Sender </span>communicating in the safest way as possible a message to a <span 
class="ecti-1000">Receiver </span>and a
relative <span 
class="ecti-1000">Criminal </span>with an opposite goal, we deduced that in order to make life
as hard as possible to the <span 
class="ecti-1000">Criminal </span>we had to built the system in such a
way that a potential criminal has to consider as many <span 
class="ecti-1000">Worlds </span>as possible
in order to be successful. This lead us to the idea of adding besides the
A.E.S. method, when hiding the message into the DNA, a list of biological
inspired security layers that have to be considered if the DNA has to be
sequenced properly. As shown by the computational simulation, the knowledge of
these <span 
class="ecti-1000">Worlds </span>has to be known by the <span 
class="ecti-1000">Criminal </span>if he wants to be successful
since considering the A.I. architecture it corresponds to the <span 
class="ecti-1000">Belief  </span>feature.
<br 
class="newline" />Finally, it is important to mention that the computational model doesn&#8217;t allow the
agents to take real actions and maybe compete between each other, however it
                                                                  

                                                                  
still provides important insights by considering the features that make one
agent as effective as possible by assuming it is rational as defined by the BDI
architecture.
