# Modelling Rational Agents through the Use of a Genetic Algorithm

The following code has been implemented for the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen iGEM 2016 team.
It simulates the behavior of two different Agents that are modeled according to a particuar Artificial Intelligence architecture
and are trained through the use of a Genetic Algorithm.

In order to run the simulation be sure to follow the following steps:

1. Install python 2.7 and the following libraries: Seaborn, matplotlib and numpy.
2. Create a res/GenAl directory in your main path for saving the results.
3. Define which Agent to simulate in main.py enabling either line 30 or 31.
4. Enable the plotting in plots.py on line 21 to see how well the generation of Agents performs.
5. Enable in plots.py the plotting option on line 67 in order to see the analysis of the Agents.

The Genetic Algorithm implements 3 different breeding techniques, however only two of them are reported in the final pdf. Nevertheless 
it is possible to use all of them for other genetic-programming tasks: Single Crossover, Double Crossover and Three Parents Crossover.
Additionally a 1% mutation rate is added to the algorithm.

In order to understand what the simulation does a report (genAlModel.pdf) is present in the directory.

If you want more information about the project this model is related to and why this approach has been used be sure to check the

**Have fun from Matthia and the whole iGEM Groningen 2016 team!!!!**
